# Digital-Image-Processing

This university assignment focuses on image processing and evaluation using multiple modified versions of the lena.png image.

Seven differently degraded images are provided, and each code cell implements a specific image smoothing technique applied independently to each case. For every image, the type of degradation and the corresponding smoothing method are explicitly described.

For each experiment, the original image and the processed output are visualized side by side, along with quantitative evaluation metrics used to assess image quality and restoration performance.

The project was implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook, leveraging standard image processing and numerical computing libraries.
